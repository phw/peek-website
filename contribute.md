If you want to help make Peek better the easiest thing you can do is to
[report issues and feature requests](https://github.com/phw/peek/issues).
Or you can help in development and translation.

### Development
You are welcome to contribute code and provide pull requests for Peek. The
easiest way to start is looking at the open issues tagged with
[up-for-grabs](https://github.com/phw/peek/labels/up-for-grabs). Those are
open issues which are not too difficult to solve and can be started without
too much knowledge about the code.

Another good starting point are issues tagged with
[help-wanted](https://github.com/phw/peek/labels/help-wanted). Those issues are
probably harder to solve, but for some reason I cannot work on it for now and
would love to see somebody jump in.

In any case, just leave a note on the issue itself that you are working on it,
to avoid multiple people working on the same issue.


### Translations
You can help translate Peek into your language. Peek is using
[Weblate](https://weblate.org/) for translation management.

Go to the [Peek localization project](https://hosted.weblate.org/projects/peek/translations/)
to start translating. If the language you want to translate into is not already
available, you [can add it here](https://hosted.weblate.org/projects/peek/translations/#newlang).

If you want to be credited for your translation, please add your name to the
[translator-credits](https://hosted.weblate.org/search/peek/translations/?q=translator-credits&search=exact&source=on&type=all&ignored=False)
for your language. The translator credits are shown in Peek's About dialog.
