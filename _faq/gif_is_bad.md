While GIF is a very old format, it has seen some rise in usage again in recent years. One reason is its easy usage in the Web. GIF files are supported nearly everywhere, which means you can add animations easily to everywhere where you can upload images. With real video files you are still more limited. Typical use cases for Peek are recording small user interactions for showing UI features of an app you developed, for making short tutorials or for reporting bugs.
