Peek makes it easy to create short screencasts of an area of your screen. It was
built for the specific use case of recording screen areas, e.g. for

- Easily showing UI features of your own apps
- Illustrate your app in software documentation and tutorials
- Quickly explain your colleague how to perform a task in the new software
- Better explain a bug you are reporting to a developer
