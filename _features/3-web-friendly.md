The main motivation behind Peek was to create simple screen casts that can be
easily shared on the web. Hence Peek supports generating GIF animations by
default, which you can share on Twitter, Facebook or other social media sites,
use on Github or include in bug tracking tools. Nearly everywhere where you can
upload images on the web you can use GIF animations.

And if GIF files are not sufficient you can record to WebM or MP4, both web
friendly video formats widely supported.
