With Peek you choose the screen area to record directly by placing the Peek
window exactly where you want to record. Then just press the record button or
press the keyboard shortcut (default `Ctrl` + `Alt` + `R`) to start recording.

Peek will remember the exact location and size of your recording area, so you
can easily redo any recording if you are not satisfied with the result.
